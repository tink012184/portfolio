    <p>
      I’m Melissa Lutz, a West ROC Specialist IV at Charter Communications and the
      developer behind <strong>Code By Lissa</strong>. I monitor network health,
      troubleshoot fiber and node events, and help agents respond quickly and confidently
      to outages.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support that work, I build automation tools, JavaScript utilities, and Angular
      apps that reduce repetitive tasks and standardize communication. Many of my projects
      started as “there has to be a better way” moments during a busy shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the ROC, I’m advancing my skills through web development courses focused
      on JavaScript, Node.js, Angular, and DevOps. This portfolio brings together my
      school projects, ROC tools, and experiments under a single purple-themed brand.
